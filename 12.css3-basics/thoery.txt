List of Selectors

Simple Selector - Select elements based on name, id and class
Combinator slector - Select elements based on relationship between them
Pseudo-class selectors - selecctor which matches components based on the additional condition 
CSS - color, import, background, font 
Pseudo-Elemnts selectors
Attribute Selectors

Combinator slector

Which explains the relationship between the selectors 

CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector.

 between the simple selectors we can include combinator 

 4 different combinators

 1. Descendant selector (space)
 2. child selector (>)
 3. adjacent sibling selector (+) - 
 4. general sibling selector (~)

Opacity - is a property which specifies the tranparency 
          of an element 
          It can take value between 0.0 to 1.0 
          0.1, 0.2,0.3...1.0
          The lower the value the more tranparent it is 

RGB - This is a color value 

RGBA - if you don't want to apply opacity to child elements 

A - Specifies the Opacity and a value between 
    0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)

RGBA - RED GREEN BLUE ALPHA :rgba(red, gree, blue, alpha)

#FF SE C2 
rgb(0,0,128)
rgba(0,128,0,0.3)

Which one to USe RGB or HEX ?

It depends on choice 
No performance differences ( both work in similar manner)
if we are familiar with HTML devlopement - we will normally use Hexadecimal number 
if we are from Deginer ( Photoshop) background - rgb 
Graphic editors - will both have hexa and RGB but when it comes to copying the values hex will have single textbox 

HEX - More convenient 
    - Easy to copy 
    - easier for daily usage 

RGB - Tranparency ( opacity) 
RGBA - RGBAlpha (0,255,5, 0.3)

CSS color Module leve draft ( alpha)
8digit Hexadecimal code 

#RRGGBBAA

#00ffaa80 == rgba(0,255,170, 0.5)

#fff easier when comparing with this rgb(255,255,255)

Background-Position 
--------------------

1. Length values (E.g. 100px 20px)
2. Percentage (E.g 100% 20%)
3. Keywords (E.g. right top )
4. Mix (E.g right 50px)

background-clip
-----------------
it defines hw far the background should extend with in element

it has 3 major properties 
1. border-box ( deafult)
2. padding-box
3. content-box

font
---------
font-family - chances the face of the font
font-style - mkes font italic 
font-weight - incraeses or decreses how bold or light our font appears
font-variant - create small caps effect, text will be in capital letters but in small size
font-size - increase or decraese the font size
font - short to specify the font properties

Font-size
------------
Absolute                 Relative
----------              ----------
- pixels (px)           - em
                        - % 

deafult font-size is 16px = 1em
font-size with pixels - user will have full control over the text

Relative
---------
Allow users to resize the text

1em is equal to 16px which is default size. 

Pixel to em
------------
pixels/16 = em

Responsive Font size ( Text size will follow the size of the browser window)
---------------------
16px
1em
25%
10vw

The text size can be set with a "vw" unit which means "Viewport Width"


CSS Text 
------------
How to manipulate text using css properties

1.  color - Set the color of the text
2.  direction - set the text direction (ltr -Left to Right , rtl - Right to Left)
3.  letter-spacing - Will help us add or subtract space between the letters that make up a word
4.  word-spacing - will help us add or subtract space between our words of sentence
5.  text-indent - indent the text of a paragraph
6.  text-align - align the text of a document
7.  text-transform - help us convert text to uppercase or lowercase letters
8.  text-decoration - we can underline, overine and strike through the text
9.  white-space - to control the flow and format of the text
10. text-shadow - will help us set text shadow around a text

Pseudo-Elemnt Selectors
-----------------------

Used to style specified parts of an element. we don't need javascript
or any other script to bring the effect.

1. Styling the first letter or first line of an element.
2. Insert the content before or after the content of an element 

        Hello,  Good Morning 
                Good Morning Everybody
        
syntax 
--------
selector::pseduo-element {
    color : red
}

:: (double colon) is introduced in css3
CSS2, cSS1 - Single colon syntax was used for both pseduo classes and pseduo elements
             
content - property in CSS which is used to generate the content dynamically 

::first-letter - Adds a special style to the first letter of text
::first-line - Adds a special style to the first line of the text
::before - Adds a text before the content
::after - Adds a text / image after the content
::selection - Matches the portion of an elemnt that is selected

Attribute Selector 
------------------

Used to select elements with a specified attribute 

for e.g  a[target] {
    color:red
}

Selects all <a> elements with a target attribute

Borders, Margin , padding, CSS BOX Model  

Borders
--------
Used to specify the style width and color of an element's border 

Border-Style 
------------
what kind of border to display 

dotted - this displays dotted border
dahsed - this displays dahsed border
solid -  This displays a solid border
double - this diplays  a double border 
groove - This displays a 3D grooved border, depends on border color
ridge - This displays a 3D ridge border, depends on border color
inset - This displays a 3D inset border, depends on border color
outset - This displays a 3D outset border. depend on border color 
none - This doesn't display any border
hidden - defines a hidden border


Border-width  ( This will not work alone, requires other porperty like border-style)
-------------
Specifies the width of our four borders ( top, right, bottom, left)

we can specifiy width using specific size - e.g. 3px , 5px, 20px

we can use pre-defined values - think , medium. thick 

it can have one to four values 

top border, right border, bottom border, left border

Border-color ( This will not work alone, use border-style property)
-----------
used to set the color of the four borders

Border-sides  ( top, right, bottom, left)
------------
used to specify border for each side

Border-shorthand
-----------------
To Shorten the code 

Border-style 
Border-width
Border-color 

Border : Style width color 

Order of Border properties 

1. Border-width 
2. Border-Style
3. Border-color 

Rounded Borders
---------------
Rounded borders will give round shape at the edges

border-radius property is used to add rounded borders to an element


Margin
-------
Used to create a space around our elements, ouside of any defined borders

It has four properties when it comes to defining the sides

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left 

Can have values - auto ( Browser caculates the margin)
                - length ( specifiy margin in px, pt)
                - % ( margin in % of width)

* Can have negative values

Margin shorthand
----------------
margin - shorthand for the margin property

if margin has 4 values
----------------------

margin : 25px   50px     75px    100px
         top    right    bottom  left

if margin has 3 values
----------------------

margin : 25px      50px            75px 
         top    left and right     bottom

if margin has 2 values
----------------------

margin :     25px                   50px      
         top and bottom        left and right     

if margin has 1 value ( all four margins are of 25px)
----------------------

margin :     25px      
         top, bottom,left and right


Margin collpase
---------------
Top and bottom margin of elements are collapsed into single margin

first element margin is 150 px and second element margin is 50 px 
then margin will be collapsed total margin will become 150px 

padding
-------
Space between element's content and element's border

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

It can have followin values - lenth - specified using px, pt, cm 
                               %    -  % width

* Negative values are not allowed

Padding + Element Width
-----------------------

Width - Specifies the width of an element's content area

if element has specified width then the padding added to that elelemnt 
will be added to the total width of an element,

Height and Width 
-----------------
Sets the height and width of an element

These can have values - auto - broswer calculates height and width
                      - length - specified in px, pt and cm
                      - % - % of the conataining block
                      - intial - deafult value
                      - inherit - inherits from parent


Outline
-------
An outline is a aline that is drawn around elements outside the border

1. Outline is drawn outside the element's border
2. Outline is not part of element's dimesnions 
3. Element's width and height will not be affected by the width of outline

properties
----------
outline-style - Sets the style of an outline
outline-width - sets the width of an outline
outline-color - sets the color of an outline
outline-offset - Space between outline and border
outline - Short hand notation , outline-width outline-style outline-color

outline-style : 
dotted
dashed
solid
double
groove
ridge
inset
outset

Outline-width
--------------

Specifies the width of the outline

it has values like thin ,medium, thick, specific size ( in px, pt)

Outline-Color
--------------
Specifies color to the outline

Outline-offset
--------------
Adds space between an outline and border of an element

Box Model
----------
All HTML elements can be considred as boxes

Box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element

You need to have a solid understanding of box model to set the width and height of an element

HTML Lists using CSS
---------------------
UL - unorderd List - items are marked with bullets
OL - Ordered List - items are marked with numbers or letters.

CSS Lists
----------
1. set different list item markers for unordered and ordered list
2. set an image as the list item 
3. Add background colors

Position of the items
---------------------
list-style-position specifies the position of list item markers

1. outside - This means bullet points will be placed outside the list items 
2. Inside - This means bulluet points will be placed inside the list items 

Document flow ( Order of code elelemnts)
--------------
It is an arrangement of page elements as defined by CSS positioning statements 
and order of the HTML elements

This is to say how each element takes up space and how other elements 
position themseleves

There are 3 ways in which we can position the elements 

1. display
2. position
3. float

display
---------
How an element is displayed

1. Every element has a default display value depnding on what type of element it is.
2. The default value for the most of the elements is Block or Inline

Block-level elements
--------------------
Always starts on a new line
takes up full width available

e.g. DIV, H1-H6, P, Form, Header, Footer, Section

Inline elements
----------------
Doesn't start on a new line, instead display next to each other
takes up as much width as necessary

e.g. span, a, image 

Override the default display value
----------------------------------

1. Every element has default diaply value, however we can override this.
2. Changing the inline element to block-level element and vice versa is possible
   this can help making a page look specific way


Note: Setting the display property of an elelement only changes how the elelemnt is 
      displayed. not what kind of elelemnt it is.


Position
--------
Specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.


It has 5 different value

1. static - default 
2. relative 
3. Absolute
4. fixed
5. sticky

Static 
---------

1. HTML elements are positioned static by default
2.  Static positioned elements are not affected by top, right, bottom, left 
3. Always positioned according to the normal flow of the page

top vs margin top
-----------------
top - is a position property, it is used with position property 
      such as relative or absolute

margin-top - Element's own property

1. static - default
--------------------
This is a default position and will have no impact even after 
adding top. right, bottom, left positions

2. Relative 
------------
It is positioned relative to its normal position, 
we can relatively position the element by uding top, right,
bottom and left

3. Absolute
------------
Absolutely positions an element inside of a parent container that 
it can reference

This completely removes the element from document flow and everything 
else renders as if that absolute element doesn't even exist at all 

4. fixed
---------

Very similar to absolute but with some minor caveats 

always fixed based on the entire HTML elelemnt, it has nothing do 
with parent element

Unique thing about fixed elelemnts is that they stay in the same place

5. Sticky
---------

Combination of both relative position and fixed position into one.

float
------
Specifies how an elelemtn should float

It is sued for positioning and formatting 

for e.g.  It will allow an image to float to left of the text 
          in a container

float can have left, right, none 

Float: clear
------------
clears the effect pf floating on the parent element.

clear-left
-----------
clears the effect of floating left on its parent element

Clear-right
-----------
Clears the effect of floating right on its parent element


Overflow
-----------
This controls what happens to content that is big to fit into a specified area

It specifies whether to clip (cut or trim) the content or add scrollbar when the 
content of elelemnt is too big 

It has got following values 

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped, content renderes outside the 
          element's box

hidden - The overflow is clipped and the rest of the content will be invisible

scorll - The oerflow is clipped, scrollbar is added to content to see the rest
         of the content

         This will add scrollbar both horizontally and vertically

auto - This is similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbar only when necessary

Note: Overflow property only works for block-level elements with a specified height
-----

Align elelements ( Horizontal align or Vertical Align)
------------------------------------------------------

center-align
----------------
To Horizontally center block-level elements use margin:auto

Setting up width of an element will prevent from stretching 
out of the edges of the container.

The element will then take the specified width and remaining space 
will be split equally between two margins.

CSS Units
------------

1. Absolute Unit
-----------------

 a. pixel (px)
 b. inches (in)
 c. centimeters (cm)
 d. millimeters (mm)
 e. points (pt)
 f. picas (pc)


2. Relative Unit
-----------------

 a. percentage (%)
 b. font-sizes (em & rem)
 c. character-sizes (ex & ch)
 d. viewport dimensions (vw & vh)
 e. Viewport max (vmax)
 f. viewport min (vmin)

 Relative Units are based on 
 -----------------------------

 1. The Parent Dimensions (%)
 2. The currently declared font attribute (em, rem, ex, ch)
 3. The viewport dimensions (vw, vh, vmin, vamx)

 Viewport dimensions
 -------------------
 1. vw - viewport width
 2. vh - viewport height
 3. vmin - viewport minimum
 4. vmax - viewport maximum

 vw, vh divide viewport in a grid of 100 Units

 Viewport - User's visible are of the webpage

 varies with device and will be smaller on a phone than on a computer

 vmin - which uses ratio of smallest size. That is if the height of the
        browser windows is less than its width 1vmin is equivalent to 1vh.
        if the the width of the browser is less than its height 1vmin is 
        equivalent to 1vw

vmax - It uses largest side. 1vmax is equivalent of 1vw if the viewport is 
       wider than it is tall. if the browser is taller than it is wide 1vmax
       will be equivalent of 1vh


Percentage vs Viewport
-----------------------
Since viewport units are a percentage of the size of the viewport, 
it can seem at first glance that specifying size as percentages would be equivalent.

The difference is that viewport units are always a percentage of the total viewport 
while percentage value applied on element is a percentage of elements's parent but
not necessarily the viewport

 ex (character-size)
 -------------------
 Relative to the x-height of the current font ( rarely used)

 x-height is roughly the height of lowercase letters such as a,b,c,d..etc

ch (character-size)
-------------------
Relative to the width of "0" 

if height is 1ch then that is equal to 8px 

em and rem (font-sizes)
-----------------------
em - relative to the font-size of the element ( parent element)

rem - relative to the font-size of the root element.

In almost every browser , 16px is the standard for proportional fonts

user can control the font-size

1 rem =16px

Absolute Units
--------------
The absolute length units are fixed and length expressed in any of these will
appear exatctly that size

You can use if you are aware of output medium ( print, screen)

Not recommended for various screen sizes

cm, mm, in, px, pt,pc

1in = 96px
1cm = 37.8px
1mm= 0.1cm = 3.78px

1em == 16px == 0.17 in = 12pt = 1pc == 4.2 mm = 0.42cm 

Inches (in)  1in = 96px = 2.54cm
---------------------------------
Inch unit is same as centimeters and used for "Print" media 

Pixel (px)
----------
Most uasble and tried measure in browser
Normalize measure for all devices and display true measurement

Point (pt) (1pt = 1/72th size of an inch)
-----------------------------------------
Used for physical measurement.

Picas (pc)  (12pt == 1pc)
-------------------------
Pics is same as point 


CSS Advanced
------------

Rounded Corners - Add special colord corners to body or text

border-radius - defines the radius of en element's corner

1. Rounded corner for an elelment with specified background color
2. Rounded corner for an elelment with a border
3. Rounded corner for an element with background image

Background-Radius is a shorhand property for 

1. background-top-left-radius
2. background-top-right-radius
3. background-botton-right-radius
4. background-bottom-left-radius

It can have one to four values
-------------------------------

With four values
--------------------
border-radius : 15px              30px                50px                  15px 

                top-left-corner   top-right-corner   bottom-right-corner    bottom-left corner

with three values
-------------------
border-radius : 15px                            30px                               15px 

                top-left-corner   top-right-corner   bottom-left-corner           bottom-right corner


with two values
-------------------
border-radius :                15px                                                30px                           

                top-left-corner   bottom-right-corner            top-right-corner           bottom-left corner

with one value 
----------------

border-radius : 25px ( this applies to all four corner)

Border Image
--------------
Allows you to specify an image to be ised instead of normal border around your element.

it has three parts :
--------------------

border-image : url("image")  25%  repeat
                   1          2    3

1. An image to use as border
2. Where to slice the image, divide your image into 9 sections
3. How the browser should apply those sections to the edges of your element

Note :  Cab be applied to any element except internal table values ( tr, th , td) 
        when border is set to collpase 

Border-Image: border-image-source -  Specifies the source of the image
              border-image-slice  -  How to slice the border
              border-image-width  -  Specifies width of the browser
              border-image-outset -  Specifies the amount by which border image area 
                                    extends beyond the border box 
              border-image-repeat - Specifies whether border image should be repeated,
                                    rounded or strechted

Gradients
---------
Gradients displays the comination og two or more colors to your element


Types
-----
Linear Gradient (down/up/left/right diagonally)
Radial Gradient

Gradients uses background image

Liner Gradient (Most common format)
--------------
direction - top to bottom ( default)

background-color - can be treated like fallback 

background-image - will be be on top if browsers supports it

background : red
background : linear-gradient (red, orange)

- This will reset other properties like background-position but it does know what we mean

Gradient axis can go from left to right or right to left or top to bottom or any angle 
that we choose.

Not declaring any angle will assume top to bottom

to make it left to right we pass additional parameter at the begining.

Starting with word "to" indicating direction like "to right"

This syntax works for corners as well. For instance if you wanted the axis of the gradient 
to start at the bottom left corner to go to the top right corner we can say "to top right"

You can also declare where you want any perticular color to start and those are called 
color-stops.

if you want more red then say red 10%, yellow, if you want more yellow the say 
yellow 10% red

Radial Gradient
----------------

This differes from linear, it starts at a single point and emanate outwards

The default is for the first color to start in the center of the element and fade to the 
end color towrads the edge of the element.

We need at least two colors to define radial gradient

readial-gradient (shape , start color, ...., last color)

by default shape is ellipse

Transistions
------------

allows to change the property values smoohtly over given duration


transistion 
transition-delay 
transistion-duration 
transition-property
transition-Timing-function

1. CSS property you want to add an effect to 
2. the duration of the effect

Note: If the durration is not specified then transistion will have no effect
-----

Transistion-Timing-Function
---------------------------
Specifies the speed curve of the transistion effect

can have following values

1. ease - specifies a transistion effect with a slow start , then fast and end slowly (default)
2. linear - specifies transition effect with same speed from start to end
3. ease-in - specifies transition effect with slow start
4. ease-out - specifies transistion effect with slow end
5. ease-in-out - specifies transition effect with slow start and end


Transform
----------
allows us to move, rotate, scale and skew elements

1. transalate - moves an elelement from its current position ( according to X-axis and Y-axis)


Position: absolute vs transform
------------------------
Position:absolute - This is placed according to its parent element, changes accroding 
           to parent's position
        
transform - This is based on itself, if the object is moved it will transalate 
            according to its new position

2. rotate - will rotate an element clockwise or anti-clockwise 
            according to given degree

3.scale - increases or decreases the size of an elelemnt (width and height)

scaleX - increase or decraese width of an element
scaleY - increase or decraese height of an element

skew
-------
Skews an element along the x and y axis

skewX - skews element along the x-axis by given angle
---------

transform:skewX(20deg)

skewX - skews element along the y-axis by given angle

transform:skewY(10deg)

matrix
--------
This combines all 2D transformatiosn into one

matrix (scaleX(),skewY(), skewX(),scaleY(), transalate())

3D Transform
------------
This uses X , Y and Z axis

rotateX - rotate an elelemnt around X-axis
rotateY - rotate an elelemnt around Y-axis
rotateZ - rotate an elelemnt around Z-axis

CSS Variables
-------------
Gives us a way /mechanism to reuse and easiliy change "repeatedly ouucring CSS propertis"

To declare CSS variable we will have to add a double dash before the name of the variable

body {
    --indian-green-color: #00FF00
    --main-text-color : red
    --div-background-color:yellow
}

:root { // pseudo class element

}

 html {

 }

complex websites and have very large amounts of css often with repated values

custome properties allows a value to be stored in one place
refrenced in multiple places
semantic identifiers

--maint-text-color eaiser to understand
